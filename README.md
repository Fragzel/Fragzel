## 👨‍💻 About Me

After a rewarding experience in technical consulting, I decided to transition into web and mobile development to pursue my passion for tech, logic, and problem-solving.

I'm constantly learning and growing, and I recently built a **JavaScript-based ERP** from scratch to deepen my understanding of application architecture, data management, and business logic.

I'm confident that **whatever the framework or tool, I can adapt and grow quickly** in any technical environment.
